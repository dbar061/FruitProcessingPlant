 * 
 * DrawableBuffer is the abstract superclass of all machines on factory floor that
 * contain a buffer that has draw methods (where some or all of the buffer spaces 
 * are drawn in the representation of the machine)
 * 
 * DrawableBuffer implements the Drawable interface and contains a copy of the
 * FactoryDimension for the machine that it is part of. It uses data from its
 * FactoryDimension to assist its draw methods.
 * 
 * Because this class needs it's buffer to be able to draw, it will usually be
 * representing a conveyor belt or similar item. ConveyorBelts and related
 * machines must be able to "advance" their belt forward. This operation is
 * represented in this class with the AdvanceBuffer method.
 * 
 * Presently, the only machine that meets these criteria is a ConveyorBelt.
 * If more machines in the future contain DrawableBuffer then we will have to
 * genericise the dimension class which we use.
