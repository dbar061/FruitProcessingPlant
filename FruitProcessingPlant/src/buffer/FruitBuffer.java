 *
 * FruitBuffer is a concrete subclass of AbstractBuffer and the close cousin
 * of DrawableFruitBuffer.
 * 
 * Unlike DrawableFruitBuffer, FruitBuffer cannot draw itself and it is used
 * in machines where the FruitBuffer does not draw.
 * 
 * A FruitBuffer is specifically designed to hold Fruit and its subclasses.
 * 
 * Unlike DrawableFruitBuffer, FruitBuffer never stores null elements. This
 * buffer actually works as a buffer (to buffer real items) and is not part
 * of a animated conveyor or similar part. Thus it only contains real Fruit
 * never null.
 * TODO this class now extends FruitConveyor. This may be incorrect!
